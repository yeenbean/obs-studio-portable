# OBS Studio Portable for Linux

OBS Studio Portable is built from [toolbx-images/images](https://github.com/toolbx-images/images) and [wimpysworld/obs-studio-portable](https://github.com/wimpysworld/obs-studio-portable) using Ubuntu. Additionally, OBS Studio Portable for Linux includes the following features:

- Includes **50 of the best 3rd Party plugins for OBS Studio**!
- Chromium Embedded Frameworks (CEF) to enable Browser Sources
- NVENC (NVIDIA) and VA-API (AMD & Intel) accelerated video encoding
- Shader and GStreamer effects filters
- Fraunhofer FDK AAC Codec
- Pipewire application specific audio capture
- VLC and GStreamer Media sources
- AJA NTV2 SDK
- [WebSockets](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket) 5.x and 4.9.1-compat are both included
- [NewTek NDI‚Ñ¢ integration](https://github.com/obs-ndi/obs-ndi) and [Teleport](https://github.com/fzwoch/obs-teleport) support
- [SRT & RIST Protocol](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Streaming-With-SRT-Or-RIST-Protocols) support
- Markdown, Pango and API text sources

Using this container image of OBS Studio Portable it is possible to run an isolated OBS Studio on *any Linux distro*.

- A complete OBS Studio for Fedora Silver Blue users.
- A fast-moving and compatible OBS Studio software stack for NixOS users.
- Run current and fully equipped OBS Studio on Debian stable.
- Run OBS Studio built with current Ubuntu interim releases with new OBS features enabled (thanks to access to newer libraries) on current and old Ubuntu LTS.

# Installation

Use [Distrobox](https://distrobox.it/) to run [OBS Studio Portable](https://github.com/wimpysworld/obs-studio-portable) on any Linux üêß distro.

- The OBS Studio configuration is exposed in your home directory on the host via the `~/.config/obs-portable` directory.
- Launching multiple instances of OBS Studio Portable containers is not recommended as the configuration location is shared.

**Running a single instance of OBS Studio Portable works great!**

1. Install Distrobox (*1.4.2.1 or newer*) and Podman (*recommended*) or Docker.
2. Create a Distrobox container for OBS Studio Portable.

```bash
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/yeenbean/obs-studio-portable:latest --name obs --pull
distrobox enter obs
```

After running both commands, the image will be available in BoxBuddy. You can
create a shortcut with BoxBuddy to make it easier to launch OBS.

## NVIDIA support

The appropriate NVIDIA libraries on the host should be automatically be linked inside the container ü™Ñ
However the capability for Distrobox to automatically connect NVIDIA libraries was recently added in Distrobox 1.5.0, and is also not supported on all distros; NixOS for example.

Therefore, if your are running an older version of Distrobox or the NVIDIA drivers are not automatically linked inside the container you can install them as follows:
  - Change the version number (***535** in the example below*) to match the version of the NVIDIA drivers you have installed on the host.

### NVIDIA complete driver stack

Required if the display is rendered by an NVIDIA GPU.

```bash
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/yeenbean/obs-studio-portable:latest --name obs --pull --additional-packages nvidia-driver-535
```

### NVIDIA compute only

Suitable for multi-GPU systems where the NVIDIA GPU is not rendering the display and only being used for compute.

```bash
distrobox create --image ghcr.io/yeenbean/obs-studio-portable:latest --name obs --pull --additional-packages libnvidia-encode-535 nvidia-headless-no-dkms-535
```

3. Run the initial setup.

```bash
distrobox enter --name obs -- true
```

4. From now on, launch OBS Studio Portable using the `obs-portable` launcher.

```bash
distrobox enter --name obs -- /opt/obs-portable/obs-portable
```

If the OBS Studio Portable container cannot connect to the host X11 server, add [`xhost +si:localuser:$USER`](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md#compatibility-notes) to `~/.distroboxrc`.
